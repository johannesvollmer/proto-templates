# PROTO-TEMPLATES

Proto-Templates aims to be a minimalist markup language.

It currently supports prototypal inheritance, including polymorphic overriding of properties.
The language will support reusing patterns by having parameters.

See the [specification](https://github.com/johannesvollmer/proto-templates/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md).

This repository implements the Proto-Templates Specification in Rust.
