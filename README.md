# PROTO-TEMPLATES

Proto-Templates aims to be a minimalist markup language.

It currently supports prototypal inheritance, polymorphic overriding of properties.
The language will support reusing patterns by using parameters.

See the [specification](https://github.com/johannesvollmer/proto-templates/blob/master/specification.md).
